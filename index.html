        <h2 class="embedded-header">All About Quaneisha</h2>
     <p>I'm originally from <i> Winston-Salem, North Carolina.</i> 
    I graduated from the <em>University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill</em> with degrees in <em>Elementary Education
    and African-American Studies.</em> After graduating, I moved to Durham, North Carolina and started my
    first teaching position at <strong>Y.E. Smith Elementary School</strong>.
    In addition, I've also taught in the <strong></strong>Chatham County Public School System</strong> and I currently 
    teach in the <strong>Wake CountyPublic School System</strong>. I've been teaching first and second grades for 20 years 
    and I've spent 15 of those years teaching in the Wake County Public School System.</p>

    <p>I'm married to the love of my life, <em> Jasper.</em>  We have two sons <em>Joshua </em> and <em>Jonathan. </em> 
    We currently reside in Fuquay-Varina. </p>

    <h1 class="embedded-header">My Favorite Ed Tech Tools</h1>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Google Suite</strong> This year I have used the Google Suite as the Learning Management System for my
    virtual classroom.  The Google Suite tools are easy to use and are effective when working with
    students. I especially love Google Slides, Jamboard, and Google Forms.</li>

<li><strong>Flipgrid</strong> I love using Flipgrid with my students.  They really enjoy using it as well.  It gives my students
    the opportunity to create videos that explain or assess their thinking as it relates to a particular
    topic. Students can also use Flipgrid to introduce themselves, participate in book talks and more.
    In addition, I love the fact that I can provide feedback by making a response video.  Students can also
    provide feedback to their classmates.</li>

 <li><strong>Kahoot</strong> This is a a game-based learning platform that makes it easy to create, share and play learning quizzes.  
    The quizzes can be played during live Google Meets or can be assigned in Google Classroom. </li>

 <li><strong>Quizziz</strong> is an online assessment tool. It's another fun and engaging way for students to take quizzes. </li>
 </ul>
